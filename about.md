## Welcome

Welcome to my blog, where I write about various, often technical, topics. I try to keep it light on technical details, so that the less technically inclined reader can also benefit.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to contact me on [Twitter]({{ site.author.twitter }}) or [LinkedIn]({{ site.author.linkedin }}).

Thanks for reading!

## Technical details

A few fun facts about how this blog is run:

* Built for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
* Hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Based on a theme from [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)

It's surprisingly easy to get a Jekyll site up and running on GitHub Pages. Check out this [excellent introduction](https://www.barryclark.co/introducing-jekyll-now/).
